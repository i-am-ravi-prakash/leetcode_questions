## [Print all subsequences of a string or an array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-subsequences-string/)

Given a string, we have to find out all subsequences of it. A String is a subsequence of a given String, that is generated by deleting some character of a given string without changing its order.

**Examples:**

Input : abc
Output : a, b, c, ab, bc, ac, abc

Input : aaa
Output : a, a, a, aa, aa, aa, aaa
