[Given an array arr[] of length N and a number K, the task is to find all the subsequences of the array whose sum of elements is K.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-all-subsequences-with-sum-equals-to-k/)

**Examples:**

**Input:**
arr[] = {1, 2, 3}, K = 3
Output:
1 2
3

**Input:**
arr[] = {17, 18, 6, 11, 2, 4}, K = 6
